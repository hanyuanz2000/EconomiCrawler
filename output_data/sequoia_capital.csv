2023-03-14 19:37:56+00:00,sequoia capital,What the loss of Silicon Valley Bank means for Silicon Valley,"Thanks to regulators,  has not meant a Silicon Valley cash crunch. Tech workers need only worry about their jobs as much as they did before. For some, relief at a bullet dodged has turned into anger at the companies quickest to pull deposits, which helped bring down their beloved bank. The next stage of grief ought to be sober risk management. According to the venture capitalist, the chance to replace  as banker to Silicon Valley is a “tremendous opportunity”. There will be no shortage of institutions with eyes on the $300bn of venture-capital dry powder waiting to be ploughed into startups. But ’s collapse will scale back Silicon Valley’s ambitions in other ways.Exactly where the dust and deposits settle remains uncertain. Reports suggest regulators are attempting another auction of , having been unable to find a buyer last weekend. Banks and private-equity funds are circling. Nonetheless, startups are finding new homes for their cash. In the chaos of last week, companies with accounts elsewhere transferred their funds. Others tripped on red tape as they frantically opened new ones. Some even wired money to personal accounts. Fintechs had a busy weekend, too. Brex, one such firm, opened 3,000 new accounts. Yet relationships between fintechs and regional banks, which have suffered in the wake of ’s collapse, may scare off potential long-term clients. The big banks are likely to be the main custodians of Silicon Valley’s cash in future. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase can scarcely open accounts quickly enough. Once there, startups can expect a safer, if considerably less intimate, service. Call it the grey-carpet treatment. On March 13th ’s British operations were acquired for £1 ($1.21) by , a multinational behemoth. The new business will account for less than 1% of loans, deposits and profits at the firm. Whether the largest institutions reassess the way they bank the smallest tech firms remains to be seen, but such firms will never be their core concern.Another question is what will happen to the venture-debt market.  was a major player, with $6.7bn of such loans outstanding when it went under. Startups used this low-cost lending to top up balance-sheets between equity funding rounds. Most now expect such loans to become more expensive, especially for the youngest firms. Venture-capital outfits are unlikely to lower themselves en masse to the comparatively small returns offered by this variety of lending. Other wheels on the venture-capital machine will need oiling, too. For example, often provided bridge financing to venture-capital firms, which enabled them to strike deals while awaiting cash from investors.The loss of  is likely to have a chilling effect on an industry already suffering from higher interest rates. Limits on financing and difficulties banking small firms will make venture capital’s adjustment to this new world harder than it otherwise would have been. Bankers may have to wait to see venture capital’s dry powder hit their deposit accounts—after all, in the last quarter, the amount of money flowing into startups globally fell by two-thirds. But sooner or later the expectations of investors and startups will realign, and firms will face dreaded “down-rounds” at lower valuations. Trips to the bank might then remind dealmakers of their own mortality. After years of exuberance, that is not necessarily a bad thing.

2023-01-18 19:48:52+00:00,sequoia capital,Venture capital’s $300bn question,"As with many other puzzles in , the answer starts with the rapid rise in global interest rates since the start of last year. Higher rates have caused the value of stocks to plummet, as investors have moved capital into safer assets such as cash and government bonds. The tech-heavy  index has lost more than a fifth of its value over the past year. In 2022 the amount of capital raised in stockmarket listings dropped to a 32-year low. Public-market slowdowns such as the one currently in progress reduce expected returns for investors in private markets by lowering the valuation at which startups “exit” into public markets. Venture capitalists therefore demand lower prices in order to invest in the first place. This especially hurts funding for late-stage startups that in normal times might be close to a public listing. Some firms, flush with cash from fundraising in 2021, are choosing to wait things out, reducing the pace of new deals. The smaller number continuing with plans must hope to avoid a dreaded “down-round”, in which a startup raises cash at a lower valuation than in a previous round—a let-down for employees and early investors who are forced to confront losses on their shares. Meanwhile, investors have become less willing to take a punt on riskier opportunities. They can no longer count on another backer following them into a deal and helping make it a success either with expertise or raw cash.The second part of the answer is more subtle. In theory, venture capitalists could spend the money they have in hand. It is, after all, already committed to their funds. For some firms, doing so would mean they would also avoid losing out on management fees which only apply to invested capital, not that merely promised to their funds, after a certain period of time. But spending at a breakneck pace would almost certainly prove to be self-defeating in the long run. Venture capitalists periodically raise money from limited partners, such as endowments and pension funds. Many of these now want to reduce their exposure to venture capital, since public markets have taken a hit and they seek to keep allocations to different asset classes in rough proportion. As a result, a handful are calling up venture-capital funds to say things to the effect of “don’t rush back” for more money, says an investor in several venture-capital funds. Venture capitalists are listening. Harry Nelis, a partner at Accel, a venture-capital firm, speculates that cash which might have taken a year to spend during the market boom will now be made to last around three times as long. And spending could get even slower. The money raised by venture-capital funds does not actually sit in their bank accounts. Instead, funds must make “capital calls” to their limited partners when they want to finance an investment. This forces the limited partner to free up cash from elsewhere in their portfolio, which they are loth to do at a time of stress. Funds are well aware that they will want to come back to their partners for more money in the future, so seek to avoid irritating them by placing calls at awkward times. Indeed, in 2001, during a slowdown which followed the dotcom bubble, some investors even “returned” committed funds to limited partners, so that their partners could reallocate the money as they wished.Venture capitalists have other reasons to be concerned about relations with limited partners. During the recent boom, funds started to poke their noses far beyond their usual concerns. Sequoia Capital, a famous outfit in Silicon Valley, launched a “superfund” which includes investments ranging from traditional venture-capital interests to public-market shares. Some limited partners thought these sorts of funds were absurdly broad, but opted to buy in anyway in order to gain access to specialist funds. Little wonder that venture capitalists are now slamming on the brakes and seeking to repair relations with their limited partners. At least as long as market conditions remain miserable, the industry’s world-conquering ambition will remain on hold.

2023-01-19 14:46:57+00:00,sequoia capital,The painful development of India’s startups,"That leaves plenty that do not. Since the beginning of 2021, the number of unicorns created in India has risen from 40 to 108. Only America and China have produced more. In 2021 promising startups had no trouble finding investors eager to fund fast-growing firms with big ideas. That year investment in startups tripled to $35bn. The momentum continued in 2022, with $3.7bn invested in March alone. Such was the clamour that startups had their pick of “founder friendly” investors who were not too bothered about supervision, the drudgery of background checks and other intrusive oversight.The environment has since cooled. Investment in December was only $900m. One reason is the woeful performance of firms that went public in 2021: Zomato (food delivery), Freshworks (enterprise software), Paytm (payments), Policy Bazaar (insurance) and Nykaa (fashion). The share prices of each has tumbled in excess of 59%. And while a global rout in tech valuations has coincided with a broader sell-off, that is not true of India. The Sensex, an index of the country’s biggest 30 firms, is close to an all-time high and the economy is growing at a decent clip. The poor performance means that other planned listings, such as that of PharmEasy, an online pharmacy, will not now go ahead. Acquisitions have been similarly hit. In October the $4.7bn purchase of BillDesk by PayU, both profitable payments companies, was cancelled. PayU’s owner Prosus, a local  firm affiliated to Naspers, a Dutch-South African company, is widely believed to have walked away because the fall in Paytm’s share price created a new, and far lower, benchmark for what a payments company is worth.Re-evaluating what startups might be worth is now the foremost concern of all India’s  firms. Funding hinges on assessing reserves, costs and the time needed to become profitable. In theory, this sort of information is available for all Indian firms because they are required to file public financial statements. But the system operates poorly. Of the 40 startups that have filed results for 2022 only three are profitable, according to Tracxn, a statistical service, and based on their annual spending, only five have enough cash to survive for over six months (see charts).In response to the tougher environment, costs are being cut. Inc42, an online publication tracking startups, counts 20,500 layoffs over the past year, probably foreshadowing a much bigger wave. Edtech has been especially hard hit, with 16 companies axing over 8,000 employees, the most coming at Byju, India’s most valuable startup, which is sacking 2,500 employees. A post-lockdown return to classrooms and low barriers to creating educational material online has raised doubts about the entire sector’s prospects.Byju has other problems. It was accused in July of inappropriately aggressive accounting and sales policies, which it denies. Other startups have also come under fire. BharatPe (payments), Trell (social media) and Zilingo (supply-chain management) saw founders quit last year after fraud accusations. BharatPe’s founder denies the allegations as does Trell; Zilingo is investigating the claims. On January 18th Amit Bhasin, a co-founder of GoMechanic, a car-repair firm, admitted to “errors in judgment as we followed growth at all costs, particularly in regard to financial reporting, which we deeply regret” after it cut 70% of its workers.These tribulations have brought the role of backers into question. Were firms sufficiently monitored? Were valuations credible? Sequoia Capital, a prominent Silicon Valley firm, has invested in GoMechanic, BahratPe, Trell, Zilingo and several edtech companies. It acknowledged in April the governance issues in various holdings and vowed to provide stricter oversight but has declined to comment further. Other foreign  firms are rethinking how they approach India, too. A more diligent approach may be required. How companies come to market is also set to change in response to the losses from public offerings. India’s stockmarket regulator made changes in September that will enable far greater scrutiny. It will force firms to provide information on the prices of private transactions that occurred before listings, as well as the key data used to derive valuations. Large investors will also be required to hold at least half of their shares through at least one accounting period to stop them selling shares during a spell of hype after an offering.These changes may not head off the carnage to come. Anand Lunia of India Quotient, a  firm in Bangalore, believes a quarter to half of the current unicorns will become zombie firms that will exist in name but cease to be funded or operate. His willingness to speak openly is unusual; his views are not. Yet for all the concerns about the immediate future, neither Mr Lunia nor many others who think sharp devaluations are coming are pessimistic about the long-term for startups. The economy is growing strongly and India is good at nurturing entrepreneurial software engineers whose skills increasingly apply in every industry. All of this suggests that the storm ahead will be followed by a resumption of growth, eventually.",https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/19/the-painful-development-of-indias-startups
2023-02-26 21:11:45+00:00,sequoia capital,How the titans of tech investing are staying warm over the VC winter,"The  giants’  comes on the back of a gigantic tech crash. The tech-heavy  index fell by a third in 2022, making it one of the worst years on record and drawing comparisons with the dotcom bust of 2000-01. According to Silicon Valley Bank, a tech-focused lender, between the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022, the average value of recently listed tech stocks in America dropped by 63%. And plunging public valuations dragged down private ones (see chart 1). The value of older, larger private firms (“late-stage” in the lingo) fell by 56% after funds marked down their assets or the firms raised new capital at lower valuations.This has, predictably, had a chilling effect on the business of investing in startups. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates made companies whose profits lie primarily in the distant future look less attractive today. Scandals like  did not help. After a bull run lasting a decade, the amount of money flowing into startups globally declined by a third in 2022, calculates Insights, a data firm (see chart 2). Last quarter it fell to $66bn, two-thirds lower than a year earlier; the number of mega-rounds, in which startups raise $100m or more, fell by 71%. Unicorns, the supposedly uncommon private firms valued at $1bn or more, became rare again: the number of new ones contracted by 86%.This turmoil is forcing the biggest venture investors—call them the whales—to shift their strategies. For Silicon Valley, it signals a return to a forgotten venture capitalism, with fewer deep-pocketed tourists splashing the cash and more bets on young companies by local stalwarts.To understand the scale of ’s reversal of fortune, consider the boom. Between 2012 and 2021 annual global investments grew roughly ten-fold, to $638bn. Conventional  firms faced competition from beyond Silicon Valley in the form of hedge funds, venture arms of multinational companies and sovereign-wealth funds, some of which began investing in startups directly. Dealmaking turned frenetic. In 2021 Tiger Global inked almost one new deal a day. Across -dom activity “was a bit unhinged”, says Roelof Botha, boss of Sequoia Capital, “but rational”, given that low interest rates made money virtually free. And “if you weren’t doing it, your competitor was.”What passed for rationality in the boom times now looks a bit insane. The downturn has spooked the  funds’ main sources of capital—their limited partners (s). This group, which includes everyone from family offices and university endowments to industrial firms and pension funds, is growing nervy. And stingy: lower returns from their current investments leave s with less capital to redeploy, and collapsing stockmarkets have left many overallocated to private firms, whose valuations take longer to adjust and whose share of some s’ portfolios thus suddenly exceeds their quotas. Preqin, a data provider, finds that in the last three months of 2022 new money flowing into  funds fell to $21bn, its lowest level since 2015. What new  funding there is increasingly goes to mega-funds. Data from PitchBook, a research firm, show that in America in 2022 funds worth more than $1bn accounted for 57% of all capital, up from 20% in 2018. How the  whales behind these outsize money pools adapt to the  winter will determine the shape of the industry in the years to come. The venture cetaceans can be divided into three big subspecies, each typified by big-name investors. First there is the conventional Silicon Valley royalty, such as Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz. Next come the private tourists, such as Tiger and its New York hedge-fund rival, Coatue, as well as SoftBank, a gung-ho Japanese investment house. Then there are the state funds, such as Singapore’s  and Temasek, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund () and Mubadala of the United Arab Emirates. As well as investing directly, they are s in other  funds; , for example, is a large backer of SoftBank’s Vision Fund. In 2021 alone these nine institutions ploughed more than $200bn into startups, from young companies to older ones looking to grow, or roughly a third of the global total. All nine whales have been badly damaged by last year’s crash. Sequoia’s crossover fund, which invested in both public and private businesses, reportedly lost two-fifths of its value in 2022. Temasek’s listed holdings on American exchanges shrank by about the same. SoftBank’s mammoth Vision Funds, which together raised around $150bn, lost more than $60bn, wiping out their previous gains; in a sign of just how bad things were, its typically garrulous boss, Son Masayoshi, sat out the latest earnings call on February 7th. Tiger reportedly lost over half the value of its flagship fund and marked down its private investments by a quarter, torching $42bn in value and leading one  grandee to speculate that it might turn itself into a family office. All three groups have reined in investments. But each has responded to the crunch in distinct ways—in part because it has affected them to different degrees. The private outsiders have been hardest hit. The combined number of startup bets by the trio in our sample fell by 76% between the second half of 2021 and the same period in 2022. Tiger has cut the target size for its latest fund from $6bn to $5bn; its previous one raised $13bn. In October Phillipe Laffont, Coatue’s boss, said the hedge fund was holding 70-80% of its assets in cash. It has raised $2bn for its “tactical solutions fund”, designed to give mature startups access to debt and other resources, as an alternative to raising equity at diminished valuations. SoftBank has all but stopped backing new startups; in the second half of 2022 most of its capital went to well-performing portfolio firms, says Lydia Jett, a partner at the Vision Fund. The other two groups are also retrenching, if not as drastically. According to data from PitchBook, in the second half of 2022 the number of deals struck by Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz fell by a combined 47%, year on year. Direct investments by the four sovereign funds in our sample fell by a more modest 31% in the period, no doubt thanks to their deeper pockets and longer horizons. The slowing pace of investment has left  investors with a record amount of capital that s had already pledged to stump up but that has yet to be put to use. Last year this “dry powder” was just shy of $300bn in America alone (see chart 3). PitchBook data suggest that our five private whales are sitting on a combined $50bn or so; the four sovereign investors hold their numbers close to their chest but their dry powder could be of a similar order of magnitude. Some of it may wait a while to be deployed, if it ever is. But some will find grateful recipients. Who they are, too, depends on which whales you look at.The old-school s and the hedge funds are focusing on younger firms, in part because volatility in the public markets makes it harder to value mature ones hoping to list soon. Mr Botha says Sequoia doubled the number of “seed” deals with the youngest startups in 2022, relative to 2021. In January the firm launched its fifth seed fund, worth $195m. Last April Andreessen Horowitz launched an “accelerator” programme to nurture startups. About half the startups Tiger backed in 2022 were worth $50m or less, compared with just a fifth in 2021, according to PitchBook.Early-stage firms won’t be the sole beneficiaries. David DiPietro, head of private equity at T. Rowe Price, a fund-management group, thinks startups selling “must-have” products like cyber-security or budgeting software should do well. Money will also keep flowing to well-run businesses with strong balance-sheets, expects Kelly Rodriques, boss of Forge, a marketplace for private securities. Firms with buzzy new technologies, such as artificial-intelligence chatbots and other whizzy “generative ”, will keep attracting capital—especially if the tech works in practice and underpins a viable business model. Another category of startups likely to gain favour is those involved in industries politicians deem strategic. In America, that means climate-friendly technology and advanced manufacturing, on which Uncle Sam is showering subsidies and government contracts. Some 8% of the deals our whales made in the second half of 2022 involved companies working on climate tech, for example, up from 2% in the same period of 2021. Last year Andreessen Horowitz launched an “American Dynamism” fund, which partly invests in businesses that rely on government procurement, such as Anduril, a defence-tech startup.Sovereign-wealth funds will be looking elsewhere. Seed deals are too small for them: whereas the typical early-stage American firm is worth about $50m, in 2021 the median value of startups backed by the sovereign funds was a whopping $650m. And what counts to them as “must-have” startups is somewhat different, determined less by the market or others’ strategic imperatives, and more by their own governments’ nation-building plans.On February 16th said it would take a stake in , a Chinese platform for video-game tournaments. This is part of a plan dreamed up by Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, to invest $38bn in “e-sports” by 2030. Temasek invests heavily in firms that develop ways to boost food production, motivated by Singapore’s goal of producing 30% of the city-state’s nutritional needs locally by 2030, up from about 10% in 2020. In the past year it has backed Upside Foods, which grows meat in a lab, and InnovaFeed, a maker of insect-based protein. Rohit Sipahimalani, Temasek’s chief investment officer, thinks that over the next few years his focus will shift towards “breakthrough innovation rather than incremental innovation”, on the back of state support for strategic tech. One group of firms is likely to see less interest from our whales. Notwithstanding ’s gaming deal, and the easing of the Communist Party’s two-year crackdown on consumer technology, the  titans are wary of China, until recently one of the world’s hottest startup scenes. An executive at a big venture fund says that in the past, foreign investors in China knew the government would respect their capital. Now, he sighs, it seems to have “pulled the rug out from underneath us”.Tiger talks of a “high bar” for new investments in China. has reportedly scaled back its investments there. Mr Sipahimalani says diplomatically that he is trying to avoid “areas caught in the cross-hairs of -China tension”. Sequoia is is said to be asking external experts to screen new investments made by its Chinese arm into quantum computing and semiconductors, two such contentious fields. The number of our whales’ deals with Chinese startups fell from 22% of the total in 2021 to 16% in 2022. After the dotcom crunch  investments needed nearly 20 years to return to their previous high. Today’s tech industry is more mature. Startups’ balance-sheets are stronger and, according to Silicon Valley Bank, their peak valuations relative to sales lower than in 2000-01. This time the whales of  won’t need 20 years to nurse their wounds. But the experience will have lasting effects on whom they back.
